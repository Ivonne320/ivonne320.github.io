## About Me

I am a Master's student at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), with a focus on computer vision and machine learning. I'm currently working as a project student working on perception task for autonomous vehicles at [VITA lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/) under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en) and Ms Reyhaneh Hosseininejad. Rooted in my profound interest in human-oriented tech, I was conducting research targeted at respiratory disease spread mechanism at [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) with [Prof. Jianjian Wei](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=N71FJjgAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) before coming to EPFL.
